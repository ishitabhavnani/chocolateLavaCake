Hey there fellow chocolate lover! If there was a dessert that celebrated chocolate in all its glory, its this one. I am talking about a nice crust on the outside and as you cut into it, there is flowing melty chocolate that oozes out. This is rich, gooey, soft centered dark chocolate that is the perfect consistency.
